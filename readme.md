# Signup Form

This project is a signup form that was created based on a design file image from the Odin Project. It incorporates form validation, flexbox, and pseudo classes to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing signup experience. This is for my portfolio and to practice my HTML and CSS skills.

## Skills used

- Form validation: The signup form includes validation to ensure that users enter valid information and meet the required criteria.
- Flexbox: The layout of the form is implemented using flexbox, allowing for flexible and responsive design.
- Pseudo classes: Pseudo classes are used to enhance the user experience by providing visual feedback when interacting with the form elements.
